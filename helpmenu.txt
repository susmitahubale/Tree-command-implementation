Options
--help     	Outputs a verbose usage listing.
--version	Outputs the version of tree.
-a	        All files are printed. By default, tree does not print hidden files (those beginning with a dot `.').
            In no event does tree print the file system constructs `.' (current directory) and `..' (previous directory).
-d	        List directories only.
-f	        Prints the full path prefix for each file.
-s	        Print the size of each file with the name.
-L level	Max display depth of the directory tree.
--inodes	Prints the inode number of the file or directory



-i	        Tree does not print the indentation lines. Useful when used in conjunction with the -f option.
-l	        Follows symbolic links to directories as if they were directories. Links that would result in a recursive loop are avoided.
-x	        Stay on the current file system only, as with find -xdev.
-P          pattern	List only those files that match the wildcard pattern. Note: you must use the -a option to also consider those files beginning with a dot `.' for matching. Valid wildcard operators are `*' (any zero or more characters), `?' (any single character), `[...]' (any single character listed between brackets (optional - (dash) for character range may be used: ex: [A-Z]), and `[^...]' (any single character not listed in brackets) and `|' separates alternate patterns.
-I          pattern	Do not list those files that match the wildcard pattern.

-p	        Print the protections for each file (as per ls -l).

-u	        Print the username, or UID # if no username is available, of the file.
-g	        Print the group name, or GID # if no group name is available, of the file.
-D      	Print the date of the last modification time for the file listed.

--device	Prints the device number to which the file or directory belongs
-F	        Append a `/' for directories, a `=' for socket files, a `*' for executable files and a `|' for FIFO's, as per ls -F
-q	        Print non-printable characters in file names as question marks instead of the default carrot notation.
-N	        Print non-printable characters as is instead of the default carrot notation.
-r	        Sort the output in reverse alphabetic order.
-t	        Sort the output by last modification time instead of alphabetically.
--dirsfirst	List directories before files.
-n	        Turn colorization off always, overridden by the -C option.
-C	        Turn colorization on always, using built-in color defaults if the LS_COLORS environment variable is not set. Useful to colorize output to a pipe.
-A	        Turn on ANSI line graphics hack when printing the indentation lines.
-S	        Turn on ASCII line graphics (useful when using linux console mode fonts). This option is now equivalent to `--charset=IBM437' and eventually is depreciated.

-R	        Recursively cross down the tree each level directories (see -L option), and at each of them execute tree again adding `-o 00Tree.html' as a new option.
